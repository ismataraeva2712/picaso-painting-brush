            <p>Lazy loading has become one of the ways to optimize React applications to speed up the load time.
                react-lazyload (npm i react-lazyload)
                react-lazy-load-image-component(npm i --save
                react-lazy-load-image-component)

                Optimizing responsive applications by lazy loading elements and images for efficiency is very important in today's development. These libraries make it easier than ever to speed up the performance of your feedback app and improve the overall user experience. Libraries such as Gatsby-Image and React-Lazyload are more suitable for lazy loading image gallery applications, and more suitable for other libraries such as eugenics elements, and for response project.</p>
